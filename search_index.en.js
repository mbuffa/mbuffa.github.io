Basically, it allows installing a Linux distribution that'll use a special Linux kernel running \"nativaly\" on Windows 10. It doesn't run on a virtualized environment, although it seems to use a Hyper-V volume for storage.\nOh, and you can also use their shiny new Terminal for ultimate ease of use.\nThe Good\nSeamless development\nYou will evolve in a familiar environment if you're already using VSCode, since it leverages its client/server architecture, each running on Windows and Linux respectively. Typing code . in your terminal will open VSCode. Extensions will be installed server-side.\nOther than that, you can enjoy the benefits of using any regular Linux distribution.\nYou can use Docker\nSince the release of WSL 2 (included in the 2004 Windows update), you can use Docker containers inside your Linux distro, managed by your Docker daemon installed on Windows. \"All\" it requires is using a WSL2 compatible distribution, and enable WSL2 integration in the Docker Desktop preferences.\nAnd, instead of using a virtual machine to host the containers, you can also set Docker Desktop to use... WSL2.\n\nI haven't made any benchmarks, but I suppose it helps to boost performance.\nI suppose you can even use your Kubernetes cluster installed with Docker on Windows from your Linux distribution, but I haven't come that far into testing yet.\nAccessing files between Linux and Windows\nYour Windows volumes are automatically mounted in /mnt, meaning you can literally access anything from your Windows installation. Also, typing explorer.exe . reveals the current folder in Windows' file manager, shown as a network shared volume.\nThe Bad\nOccasional bugs and freezes\nI do backend development in Ruby (and Rails), Elixir (and mostly Phoenix) professionally, and I also wrote a bit of Elm and Rust in WSL2. I am quite satisfied with the quality of the integration WSL2 offers, but it isn't bug-free either.\nFor example, when I first tried Zola and ran its web server, I just couldn't connect to it with my browser. Firefox was just displaying \"Unable to connect\". The reason? I don't know, but running wsl.exe --shutdown would \"solve\" this problem. I'm obviously more annoyed by the fact that I need to reboot than the fact that I only lose a few seconds of my time every week or so.\nBut the most annoying thing was occurring during the compilation of my Rust project through Docker (it never happened when I was building \"on bare metal\"), which was the complete freeze of VSCode, my terminal, and really, any app related to WSL. In that case, I'd need to wait for a few minutes for the build to finish and my system to be responsive again. I assume this has something to do with my building process eating all of the IO reserved for WSL, or something related to this weird Docker setup.\nWondering about long-term stability\nWhile Microsoft provided a migration script to switch from WSL to WSL2 (through the use of wsl.exe, to run in cmd.exe or PowerShell), it never worked on the Ubuntu I installed a few months ago, so I tried a few several other distributions (Alpine, Arch) after finally installing a fresh new Ubuntu, which worked instantly with Docker integration. I think not all distributions available on the store are compatible with WSL2, but information is a bit scarce.\nSo far, my setup has been very stable, but I wonder if a future Windows update could break the whole thing. I got almost anything versioned and hosted somewhere, but still.\nAnd sure, there's bugtracking through Github, but I think WSL as a whole is pretty opaque and hard to debug yourself.\nThe Ugly\nGet out of my $PATH\nTo achieve a seemless integration with Windows, my Ubuntu installation has basically the whole Windows mess injected into its default $PATH:\n\nWhish is... yeah. It itched me in many places when I saw this, and when I saw random DLLs popping in my autocompletion. But this is sadly probably the price to pay for this kind of integration.\nThere's a setting to disable this (and even a few other things), but my distro just didn't cared about my feelings and refused to apply it. Judging by the comments section, I'm not alone in this situation.\nThis kind of dirty black magic may annoy you if you want your distro to be 100% clean. But I guess you wouldn't want to use WSL in the first place in that was the case ;)\nConclusion\nI'm very satisfied with WSL and its related developments so far. My primary reason for using it is the need for good UI and accessibility tools, because I have an extremely low vision (but I'll run into details in a future article) but it's also really satisfying to leverage a good CPU (in that case, a Ryzen 3800X) instead of the traditional coughing overpriced Macbook Pro any startup company grants its employees with.\nAnd of course, you can launch a game or two when you need a break.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20200816-developing-on-wsl/","title":"Developing on WSL"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20201022-elixir-clustering-on-kubernetes/":{"body":"Context\nWhen developing Elixir applications, you may want to create a cluster of Erlang nodes at some point, for example, to provide redundancy, high availability,or to share a global state on the cluster (with Mnesia, for example) without hitting an outside DBMS.\nThis can be easily achieved with libcluster. As you can see in the docs, it supports multiple strategies.\nI'll assume you want to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster, and I'll be covering this strategy only (Cluster.Strategy.Kubernetes) for simplicity sake, but you may find some bits interesting even if that doesn't apply to your case. I'll also assume that you already have a working basic Kubernetes deployment setup.\nWe'll deploy a cluster of Erlang nodes. To avoid confusion with Kubernetes terminology, I'll use the prefix k8s when referring to Kube.\nA word about WSL\nYou may run into one issue if you're using WSL: by default, WSL systems use the same hostname as their Windows host, which isn't fully qualified, and Erlang may not like that.\nTo fix this (and to avoid breaking WSL), you can specify a full computer name on Windows.\n\nGo to your PC settings (This PC -&gt; Properties -&gt; Change Settings -&gt; Change),\nIn the Computer/Domain Changes window, keep a simple Computer Name,\nClick on More, and in the DNS Suffix and NetBIOS Computer Name window, specify a primary DNS suffix (like localdomain).\n\nYou can keep the other settings unchanged, provided you have something like barney as computer name and barney.localdomain as full computer name.\nConnecting nodes locally\nLet's make a new clean project with Mix:\n\nAnd let's start a iex REPL, giving it a new argument:\n\nHere, we just passed a flag to the Erlang VM, specifying the shortname of the node we want to run.\nThere's now a slight difference appearing in your prompt:\n\nYou should see your PC hostname at the right of that @ symbol. This is a default value, because we haven't specified a fully qualified name.\nLet's start a second Elixir app, in another terminal:\n\nAnd let's discover a few functions!\n\nnode() (or Node.self()) returns the name of the current Node.\nNode.list() returns a list of the connected Nodes in the cluster. At this point, it should be empty.\nNode.connect() and Node.disconnect() allow you to, you guessed it, connect and disconnect nodes. Let's try it!\n\nOn the b Node, type:\n\nNow, go back to the a Node, and run:\n\nYou should see b@hostname appearing there. Congratulations :) We haven't done anything spectacular this far, but this is exactly what libcluster will do under the hood once it's set up correctly.\nTodo\nSo, here's what we'll have to do:\n\nPass the relevant fully qualified name to each Erlang VM\nUpdate our Kubernetes configuration\nDefine a cluster topology to configure libcluster\n\nVM Args\nWe'll need to pass some arguments to our Erlang VMs.\nSince at least its version 1.10, Mix can handle this (you won't need to add Distillery as a dependency).\nIn your project directory, run:\n\nThis command will generate a few files. Let's take a look at vm.args.eex. It should contain a few commented lines, specifically:\n\nSince we want to set name and deploy on Linux containers, let's get to env.sh.eex. There's a few commented lines in there, but we're most interested in the last block:\n\nTo enable clustering, we need to replace the 127.0.0.1 part with the fully qualified name of our pod. Kubernetes has its own internal DNS, and pods are typically named like this:\n\nSo your setup should end up looking like this:\n\nBoth $POD_IP and $NAMESPACE will have to be defined when our application starts, so we'll add those to our k8s deployment manifest.\nKubernetes configuration\nWe should now declare our two new environment variables:\n\nBoth variables references the pod's information once it's started. You can check it by running:e by running:\n\nIf you already have one pod correctly labelled, you can check that libcluster will correctly poll the right pods from Kube by doing what it does: polling with a labelSelector:\n\nIf this returns off-topic pods, then you should fix this before proceeding :)\nLibcluster topology\nLast, but not least, we need to specify our libcluster strategy:\n\nOnce you deploy this, you should be good :) After scaling up your deployment (kubectl scale --replicas=X deployment/my-app), you should see various [libcluster] log entries on your pods.\nWhat now?\nThere's a few things to toy around with if you want to leverage your cluster!\nStarting from there, and after cleaning your configuration and/or setting up cleaner environment variables, there are a few interesting things to do. How about:\n\nDeclaring a GenServer tracking nodes status?\nImplementing a Cluster Singleton worker using Individual?\nToying around with Phoenix.PubSub?\nPlaying with process registries, like Phoenix.Tracker?\nDiscovering Erlang's Mnesia, a powerful in-cluster DBMS to use for internal state or cache, and which makes Redis irrelevant?\n\nNode up/down notifications\nErlang exposes a simple function that'll get the current process notified when nodes are up or down. This can allow us to react accordingly, like printing debug information in the logs, dereferencing the node, or push the self destruct button.\nIn our first example, if you had run the following before connecting the two nodes together:\n\nThen running flush would show you the messages you received:\n\nYou can call monitor_nodes in a GenServer, of course, and implement the relevant callbacks:\n\nConclusion\nThis article is a bit long and rough around the edges, but it should give you a better understanding on how to deploy Elixir applications as a cluster.\nI strongly suggest that you follow the official documentations of Elixir, Erlang and libraries. The snippets I included may get outdated over time, though I don't expect the process to be easier than it currently is :)\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20201022-elixir-clustering-on-kubernetes/","title":"Elixir: Clustering on Kubernetes"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20201111-elixir-troubleshooting-mnesia/":{"body":"Context\nMnesia is a powerful DBMS implemented in Erlang which you can use in your Elixir application.\nWhy would you want to do that?\n\nIt can span over multiple nodes in your cluster, providing redundancy and recovery mechanisms.\nIt prevents you from adding an external dependency like Redis, PostgreSQL, or whatever.\nIt provides all the features you need from a solid DBMS like transactions, locks, indices, dumps to disk, and a consistent data structure.\n\nAfter looking at and evaluating alternatives when working on a project at Pandascore, I finally decided to give a shot at Mnesia for storing an internal state. It took me a few hours to set it up correctly, but I ran into several issues that may drive anyone nearing an end of sprint crazy, so here's a few tips for it :-)\nOne disclaimer though: this project is in production (\\o/), but due to other priorities, I'm not really monitoring it or improving the design, and thus learning more about Mnesia.\nSo this is pretty much a beginner to beginner feedback. Please take it with a pinch of salt.\nSome useful links\nSince I'm pretty much writing an addendum, you'll find more exhaustive information with the following articles and resources. You can read them afterwards if you prefer, and go back to this article if you encounter any issue.\nFirst, this excellent article from Welcome to the Jungle gave me a good overview on how to setup Mnesia in a cluster.\nTwo more links are mentioned at the end of this article, but I'll paste them here too. Elixir School has a good walkthrough from begin to end mostly, and of course, the Erlang documentation is a gold mine, though it can be a bit rough to read if you're well-versed in Elixir but not Erlang.\nYou can also check my article on deploying an Elixir cluster on Kubernetes since I give a few details on how to set up a simple local cluster. I'll do it more quickly here anyway.\nLet's create a sample project\nLet's create a simple project to try out Mnesia locally. We'll need to run a small cluster, so we'll throw in one specific library.\n\nAnd let's head out to mix.exs to add libcluster:\n\nAnd let's define a very simple Supervisor. This will get our ClusterSupervisor\nstarted, with a simple configuration for our local experiments!\n\nThis will get you started with a small cluster of two nodes. Epmd is\nperfectly fit for our example here, since we just have to specify a few hosts.\nNow, let's open two shells and start two instances:\n\nNow, running Node.list() in each REPL should give you exactly one atom:\n\nInitializing Mnesia\nNow, let's start actually using Mnesia. We'll pretend we're running a small wildlife protection office taking care of local racoons.\nAlso, for the sake of simplicity, we'll add it directly to the children of our app. There's no need for complexity for hello world code :)\n\nThere are a few important things to note here.\nFirst, you need to create a schema before starting Mnesia. This is really important. Try switching the two lines to see what happens.\nThen, you're free to create your table. Both schema and table can be already created when you run your app, since Mnesia keeps RAM and disk copies, depending on how you configure it. By the way, you should have noticed there are now two new folders in your project directory:\n\nHmm, let's see if Mnesia is properly configured. Type this in a terminal:\n\nThis will be your best friend for debugging Mnesia :)\n\nHmm, looking at running db nodes, we're only running two Mnesia nodes independently. We want to connect them, but we have to do it ourselves when new nodes are connected.\nLet's go back to our Store and add a bit of code:\n\nWe want to be notified when new nodes connect...\n\n\n\n...And we want to configure Mnesia to use extra nodes, create a table copy on the other node, and remove the other node when connection is lost.\n\n\nNow, restarting our two nodes should raise an error:\n\nWhy is :mnesia.change_config(:extra_db_nodes, Node.list()) returning :ok with an empty array?\nWell, you can't really guess, and silent errors is why Mnesia can be difficult to work with for the first time.\nIn fact, Mnesia requires that you create an identical schema on each of your nodes, sharing the same cookie. By calling setup_store() and its :mnesia.create_schema(), you're creating two conflicting schemas Mnesia can't resolve.\nLet's remove setup_store() completely (and ensure_schema_exists() too). If we need to be able to deploy single nodes (locally for example) we can still define an environment variable to decide what to do. But this is off-topic.\nAlso, remember those two folders that popped up in your directory? Remove those folders. Those may contain conflicting schemas.\nNow, let's restart our two REPLs.\n\nWell, you can't guess either, but Mnesia must be started as an application. Surprisingly enough, trying to use :mnesia functions wouldn't raise any errors.\nSo let's head to our manifest and add :mnesia in a familiar place:\n\nNow let's check...\n\n\nSee how opt_disc and running db nodes changed. But we have no data yet.\nInserting data\nWe'll add some code and make some changes so that we'll use a struct defined in Types.Racoon. The naming in my example isn't great, but basically, we're just adding serialization/deserialization functions to manipulate structs in our codebase, while Mnesia stores tuples.\nSo we'll add two functions, list() and create(), and do a few changes on the table name.\n\nNow let's test a few examples, after a REPL reset.\n\nThe update, read, and delete functions are quite straighforward. You can implement them yourself, but I'm adding those as a reference.\n\nYou can play around with this :) Note that creating data on one node, and creating the identical data on another node doesn't raise any issue, but do not create duplicates either.\nThere's one issue remaining though: closing both REPLs clear the table. This is because we forgot to specify one option when calling :mnesia.create_table!\n\nNow we're good, and :mnesia.info() doesn't show an empty disc_copies anymore.\nA few important notes for releases...\n...and solving the \"bad cookie\" issue.\nKeep in mind that we've been using iex all along and that running a compiled application will raise a few differences.\nRemember the snippet I used for adding :mnesia to our running application?\n\n\nWell, it might cause you some trouble once you compile your release with mix release and your node starts.\nThing is, adding libraries to extra_applications would start them automatically before your application does, so we have to specify\nthat we only want to reference it in our release, to avoid :mnesia creating a schema and starting automatically.\n\nThing is, I also had to revert my changes on create_table and remove the disc_copies option.\n\nNow, :mnesia.info() will properly display a populated disc_copies option.\nI do not know why those differences between iex and compiled code exist. I may be doing something wrong, so please feel free to open an issue on the repository if you find why!\nConclusion\nI hope this was neither too tedious or frightening regarding the usage of Mnesia in your project. I thought the \"crash course\" format to be interesting in this case (ie. amending snippets), because it helps to have beaten that path when things go wrong.\nI didn't mention the issue of network partitioning and a possible way to solve it, but this is more related to your cluster configuration. Essentially, network failure may happen inside your cluster, and reconnecting nodes wouldn't know how to handle this, since we're not using a master-replica strategy. I haven't read much about this, but one possible solution would be to pass the cluster size as an environment variable to all nodes, and check the Node.list() result when a :nodedown message is received. Afterwards, a simple calculation should be enough to determine if your node is isolated or in a dominant group, allowing you to push the self-destruct red button with, for example, a \"liveness\" GenServer exposed to your orchestrator, returning HTTP 200 Ok responses codes until isolation is detected.\nNote that there's also the Mnesiac library, which is an Elixir layer on top of Mnesia. I prefer using low-level libraries directly, at least for learning, but it might be a good fit for production though.\nLast, but not least, I created a repository with a small and clear commit history, in case you want to tinker with it.\nEt voilà.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20201111-elixir-troubleshooting-mnesia/","title":"Elixir: Troubleshooting Mnesia"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20210706-postgres-filtering-with-count/":{"body":"Context\nDoing a COUNT() in SQL is pretty simple, but sometimes you want to return several counts at once with different filters.

I learned as I went, mostly by looking at examples and documentation. If you're looking for tutorials or courses, there are pretty good resources available for free. This great article gives some very useful tips to learn by doing, and there's even an official interactive tutorial.\nAnd, of course, you also need to know Docker :-)\nLet's get started\nLet's take this stripped down deployment example, named deployment.yaml:\n\nYou would typically associate this with a Kustomization.yaml file:\n\nThis file allows you to define values shared across multiple resources (like services, jobs, ingresses...), either by editing it directly, like this:\n\n...or programmatically, for example, in your CI:\n\nRunning kustomize build . in the directory containing your kustomization and deployment would result in an output that you could apply directly with kubectl apply. Just run kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f - and you're good to go.\nNow let's say we want to add an annotation at build time in our CI with an environment variable, like this:\n\nThis can be pretty useful if, for example, you want to do a new deployment even if the docker image specified in that deployment hasn't changed.\nRunning kustomize build . now would keep that line as-is.\nIn that case, you could add an annotation programmatically, like this:\n\nBut then all your resources would be affected, mearning that your service and ingress would also be redeployed in that example. In some cases, you really want to scope your changes.\nTo use environment variables, you need to specify them in your Kustomization, in a vars: section:\n\nEach variable defined here must have a name and references to let Kustomize know where it's supposed to get that value. In that example, I'm using a configMap, which is often the best option to store configuration.\nWhile we could definitely define a ConfigMap ourselves as part of our Resources, we would lose the ability to define that variable at build time.\nThat's why we want to build a ConfigMap programmatically, by sourcing a file we'll create in our CI:\n\nThere's one more thing we need to do though. For the sake of testing your code locally, just create a file named environment-properties.env containing the following content:\n\n(You should keep that file tracked in your CI, it would make debugging locally easier.)\nRunning kustomize build . at this point would, still, keep that variable as-is. That's because we try to substitute a value in a field that Kustomize doesn't look in by default, probably for performance or security concerns.\nTo fix this, we need to add a custom transformer. Put that in your Kustomization:\n\nAnd then create env-var-transformer.yaml with that content:\n\nNow, running kustomize build . locally should give you the expected result.\nFinally, in our CI job, we can build that file:\n\nNow running kustomize build . would result in this :-)\n\nTada!\nKustomize has a predefined list of fields it'll actually replace corresponding patterns with environment variables. You can check this list directly in the repository. If you want to do variable substitution in a field that is not in that list, you can follow the section I want to put $VAR in some (currently disallowed) field on this Github issue, which points to the aforementioned source file.\nHope this will help some people stumbling around here.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20210720-kustomize-environment-variables/","title":"Kubernetes: Using Environment Variables with Kustomize"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20210916-elixir-environment-variables/":{"body":"Context\nAn environment variable is a widespread programming concept that refers to a value coming from the system, being read by an application at runtime. Elixir can be a bit surprising on that aspect for beginners.\nThis is one way of accessing an environment variable:\n\nAnd the same call would work in your application source code.\nHowever, you may want to avoid scattering those calls in every corner, and use a config file instead to centralize your settings and your default values.\nMix doesn't generate config files by default, so you'd have to create one of those, like this:\n\nAnd edit your config/config.exs file, like this:\n\nAnd lastly, modify lib/foo.ex like this, to actually use the key-value pair we defined:\n\nNow, we want to produce a build, but let's define our environment variable just before we do that:\n\nNow let's run an interactive terminal to our build, and let's override that env variable along the way:\n\nThere, calling Foo.hello would return \"foo\", not \"bar\".\nYou can easily get surprises when releasing your first Elixir app, because this is not something you can reliably reproduce with iex -S mix locally.\nWhat happened\nWell basically, exs files are script files: they're used at build or test times, and aren't present in your final build. When building your release, Mix interpreted System.get_env directly and hardcoded the value.\nSolutions\nOne exception to that is the Elixir 1.11 addition config/runtime.exs file, meant to be \"compiled\" at runtime.\nOf course, you could argue that using System.get_env directly in your source code would work, but I would say this wouldn't be a great idea ;-)\nThere's an alternative to config/runtime.exs though, which is the env library. It lets you define tuples in your config files, and a getter similar to Application.get_env:\n\nEt voilà ! Hope this helps.\nIf you want to know more about Elixir builds and releases, as always, the official documentation is a great place to start.\n2025 Update\nI wanted to make an update a while ago to state one thing: you probably don't need a library such as env in your application. You just have to remember the following statements:\n\nYour configuration is split between environments (config/{dev,test,prod}.exs) which is built at compilation time\nYou have to make sure your environment variables are defined at compilation time if you make calls to System.get_env, otherwise, your config would contain empty settings You can check this article for the most optimal way to do that locally.\nThere's one exception to that: config/runtime.exs is always evaluated at runtime, and not only in production. This is where you can reliably call System.get_env. Just be cautious and insert production configuration inside the right \"block\" in there, because it's also used for dev and test.\n\nThere's actually another exception you may come across in older Elixir projects, which is config/releases.exs, used until Elixir v1.11.0.\nFinally, checking both Elixir and Mix documentations for your versions is always a good idea.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20210916-elixir-environment-variables/","title":"Elixir: Using Environment Variables"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20211029-homebrew-bundles/":{"body":"Context\nIf you're using the Homebrew package manager on your Mac, there's a small chance you may want to backup your list of packages and to be able to restore them in one command, especially if you got a computer for personal use and another one for professional use, or in case you have to restore your setup for whatever reason.\nHomebrew provides bundles that does just that.

I'm pretty sure Kubernetes namespaces are completely isolated compartments, but I tried to access that secret in my default namespace nonetheless, without success.\nAlso, that certificate would be renewed every once in a while.\nSo I basically had three solutions:\n\nCopy the secret manually, initially and then after each certificate update\nUpdate the certificate update procedure, so that the person updating it would also update the one in my namespace\nCopy the secret on a regular basis, either with a Kubernetes CronJob or a deployed app\n\nThe first solution was too error-prone. I'd rather write and validate a script once and schedule it, rather than trusting my self in six months, with clouded memory and human nature.\nThe second solution would have required me to have access to that update procedure, and having anyone deploying in a new namespace the obligation to update that procedure (or warn about it) for each new namespace. Not really resilient to human errors and not scalable by definition.\nThe third solution was the most tempting, but I found a more elegant and equally reliable way to do this.\nSolving this with an Operator\nA Kubernetes Operator is a fancy word for applications subscribing to the Kubernetes event loop and executing some code in return. Classic PubSub.\nOperators aren't a ressource as can be Pods, Deployments or ConfigMaps. They're just deployed apps with a certain design, and there are several ways to create one.\nThe Don't-Reinvent-The-Wheel way\nIn my case, I wanted to have something running in a reanosably short timespan. There are ways to build your own operator \"from scratch\" (at least, without having to invent the universe), but I went for an \"out-of-the-box\" solution called shell-operator, allowing you to write a simple YAML manifest for the subscription, and some UNIX shell scripting for the code execution.\nThe README is pretty straightforward and does a very good job, so I won't elaborate step-by-step on this. There are even examples, such as this one. I wouldn't do a better job than the author himself. Advertising the use of Operators is the best I can do here :-)\nAnyway, you basically end up with a Dockerfile, a shell script both used to create the subscription hook and the code execution (in which you can of course run kubectl apply -f if it has the required permissions), and you only have to build your new container and deploy it.\nIn my case, I ended up having a specific deployment for every namespace I deployed (and that is intended to not be a temporary namespace, and have a lifetime superior to the renewal period). I could have deployed only one operator and have it update the secret in all namespaces at once, but that basically killed the principle of compartmented and independant namespaces.\nThe Do-It-Yourself way\nI also like to master what's happening and have a low-level understanding of things, so I'll try to update this article (or create a new one) about creating your own operator soon. Yeah, sorry, that section is currently a scam.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20220122-kubernetes-operators/","title":"Kubernetes: Creating and using Operators"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20231212-postgres-autogenerated-fields/":{"body":"Context\nAttention: This feature isn't specific to PG, but that's the only RDBMS I use on a regular basis, so variations may apply.\n\nTL;DR: You can define a field generated at row insertion, instead of inferring a dynamic value.\n\nWhen designing your data model using a relational database, you might encounter a case where you'd need to link a table to numerous other tables.\nIn that case, you might be tempted to use a polymorphic association, but this comes at the cost of sacrificing data integrity with the loss of foreign keys.\nOne simple alternative consists of having one foreign key per relation. It is simple and reliable, at least until you reach a large number of foreign keys.\nLet's say we have the following schema:\n\nWe might want to know the \"type\" of relation our row is linked to, without having to use a case-when statement on each SQl query, which would be costly - and/or at least inefficient.\nHow about adding a string field representing the relation type? It's fine. But our model may change, and we might have to declare a new type, and yet forget to add the new possible value.\nThis is a situation where SQL generated columns can be handy.\nUsage\nA generated column is typically created like this:\n\nA few key points here:\n\n$GENERATION_EXPRESSION can be any statement returning a value,\nPostgres only supports stored values.\n\nSo, in our case, the field definition would look like this:\n\nImplications\nIntroducing new foreign keys\nYou may need to introduce new foreign keys. In that case, you'll need to alter the table again and add a new condition to your generator expression.\nYou might be tempted to add a default \"unknown\" value, but I think explicit failure should be prefered in that case.\nTesting\nSince we basically have an enumeration, we might want to iterate over this enumeration in our tests, so that we can check that our codebase actually handles all the possible values it can take (eg. for exposing values on a GraphQL API).\nAnd it turns out we can retrieve that information from Postgres!\n\nThis will return the raw SQL statement used to generate new values. It's a bit sketchy, but you can parse this expression with simple regexps and extract what you need.\nConclusion\nGenerated fields are a simple but powerful tool, and you can use it in a lot of scenarios I didn't mention, such as generating a tsvector for full text search, or simplifying basic yet cumbersome checks.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20231212-postgres-autogenerated-fields/","title":"Postgres: Using SQL generated columns"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20250227-loading-env-without-leaks/":{"body":"Context\nIf you're developing a server or a web app, and this server needs to interact with third-party services, you're probably going to use a .env (dotenv) file to define those variables. At least, when running your project locally.\nSo, you would probably end up doing something like export $(cat .env | xargs), and then running your process.\nThis approach has one major drawback: it updates the environment of your current shell, and it has a few implications:\n\nIf you're working with several services, with various dotenv files, you may end up overwriting variables, or relying on variables defined by other services...\n...worst-case scenario, you end up connecting to a production database when running a task that was supposed to run against a test database, and things go wild.\nYou may leak tokens every time you call env in your terminal. Not ideal if you're streaming your content.\n\nYou can actually make sure your application loads its necessary environment variables without those inconveniences, either by using a Shell script, or a Makefile. Two very simple solutions compared to, say, setting up and maintaining SOPS1.\nSo, basically by adding something like server.sh with the following:\n\nYour env will be loaded inside the context of a new TTY (if I remember my UNIX lessons correctly).\nIt also works with Makefiles (and yeah, I hate the syntax, it's annoying and weird, but I always end up writing Makefiles):\n\nAnd that's it. Also, make sure your variables are properly defined (such as FOO=bar, without quotes) because having additional quotes may cause issues (some loaders would escape quotes).\nNot a revolutionary take, but better be safe (and clean) than sorry!\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20250227-loading-env-without-leaks/","title":"Unix: Loading env variables, without messing up your environment"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20250725-live-view-session/":{"body":"Context\nIn its early versions and up until v1.0, Phoenix LiveView has been designed to let you manage one LiveView at a time. But in a few cases, you'll need to be able to manage multiple Live Views, for either a complex dashboard, or even a navigation menu living on the side.\nIn my case, I had to implement a navigation bar in one of my projects, with a different class for the active element. Using a Live Component was not possible, because those can't be called from a regular (non-Live) template.\nAlthough, since Live Views are GenServers, and therefore Processes, having one Process per user constantly running just for displaying a dynamic navigation bar isn't great. It would be much better to save those few kilobytes of RAM, and do the work with pure CSS and JS hooks, therefore offloading the logic to the client. But let's just consider we need two LiveViews sitting next to each other for our use case.\nThis is where live_session/3 comes into play.\nUsage\nlive_session/3 is a Router-specific \"word\" (in the Router DSL) that lets you define a handful of things:\n\nA name to identify it\nA session argument, in case you want to put a value in the connection (HTTP) Session\nA root_layout argument, in case you want to override it (it may already be specified in your pipeline)\nA layout argument, to specify a \"partial view\" that'll be rendered inside your root layout\nAn on_mount callback to specify a list of functions to call in order to update the socket\n\nExample\nThis is how my code looks like:\n\n\n\nAnd the NavLive module here is just a navigation bar built with Petal Framework, defining list items and picking the right Tailwind class for the active item.\nThat's it :) Please keep in mind that using a Live Session for something that could be offloaded to the client (with JavaScript and hooks) isn't great, but this gives you an idea on what structure to use, in case you're building a complex trading dashboard, and you absolutely need to have separate LiveViews on the same page, for concurrency reasons or resilience.\n","id":"https://mbuffa.github.io/articles/20250725-live-view-session/","title":"Elixir: Having multiple Live Views on the same page"},"https://mbuffa.github.io/contact/":{"body":"My name is Maxime Buffa.
