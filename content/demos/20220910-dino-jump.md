## Controls

- Hit `Space` to jump and restart the game

## Context

This is just a very small prototype I made on a train with Rust and Macroquad.

You control the black rectangle on the left. Just hit `Space` to avoid incoming obstacles and score higher.

## Repo

Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/mbuffa/game-prototypes/tree/master/00-dino-jump)
