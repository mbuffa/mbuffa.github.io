## Controls
* Left mouse click: Place regular turret
* Right mouse click: Place laser turret
* Escape: Take manual control of standing by turrets
* Escape again: Take the turret back to automatic mode

## How to play
There's neither winning nor losing mechanic at the moment, so you can take your time :D

* Targets will spawn from the top of the screen
* You can place turrets to destroy them; each turret has its own sensor and `will shoot automatically`
* Place turrets using your muse: left click deploys a `regular turret`, right click deploys a `laser beam turret`
* Regular turrets shoot projectiles at a medium pace (for 20 damage)
* Laser Beam turrets concentrate a beam on their target, inflicting low damage constantly
* Targets have 100 health points

## Context
It's been a while since I wanted to prototype a small turret, similar to what can be found in Team Fortress 2:

{{ youtube(id="E6Aa0j3pQUc", class="video_embed") }}

The idea was basically to have a Turret featuring those characteristics:
* Separate Sensor and Cannon, with the Sensor moving left to right (60 degrees on each side)
* A basic AI able to operate the turret, switching its internal state and rotating the cannon to the next target

And that's pretty much it. I didn't intend to make anything playable out of it, but I may end up refactoring on a regular basis and adding new features, as it's much funnier than I initially expected.

Using Rust and Macroquad was truly a bless, although I'm still unsure on how to solve some issues I encountered. I approached Rust in 2015 initially, but got back to it only very recently, and both the language and its tooling are amazing. Macroquad is a fantastic library to prototype games, as well.

I will probably continue streaming game dev, either this prototype, or new ones, so please [head over to Twitch][0] if you're interested in that!

## Goals
Those items are on my To-Do list:
* Add more sounds and replace my awful placeholders (once I figured out how to make samples); got any SimCity 2000 vibe with that laser beam sound :D?
* As suggested on my Twitch channel, implement a network of sensors with a simple PubSub design, allowing one turret to alert the other ones; possibly adding the possibility to deploy Sensors directly as well
* Fix the laser beam collision detection (currently, if a target appears between a laser beam turret and its target, nothing happens)
* Fix the annoying right click behavior on that page (yeah, I know)
* Possibly refactor and make a game out of it, like a tower defense

## History
* 2022-11-20: Laser beam turrets!

* 2022-11-15: More bug fixes
  * Introduction of an Assets store
  * Fixed target spawns

* 2022-11-08: Various bug fixes
  * Turrets can now follow their target
  * Some sounds were added

* 2022-11-07: Initial implementation
  * One turret in the center of the screen, with a sensor moving left to right
  * A functional cannon (manual)
  * A functional AI, using the sensor to detect targets and rotating the cannon to shoot at them
  * Target spawns from the top of the screen
