My name is Maxime Buffa. I am a software developer specialized in backend and API development, with a bit more than 6 years of experience as of 2020, mostly with Ruby on Rails, although I tend to look at Elixir, Rust and Crystal for my future developments.

I love tinkering with a new language, finding new tools, breaking down the unknown and discovering new ways to use and ship optimized, reliable and fast software to a Kubernetes cluster.

I also love almost every topic related to video games that does not include microtransactions or addictive mechanics, ranging from game design as a whole to writing and art. Which is why you'll find some video games reviews here as well.

#### Contact
Some of my projects are hosted on [Github][0]. But my epic commits history is on a private Gitlab.

And [CoderWall][2].

And, *of course*, on [Linkedin][99].
