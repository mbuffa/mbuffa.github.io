Hello. My name is Maxime. I got 12+ years of experience building backends and SaaS products, with a mastery of Elixir (Phoenix) and Ruby (Rails) ecosystems, used to work in small teams with a high level of ownership and responsibility. I'm also proficient in DevOps (Kubernetes, AWS), and in shipping software from A to Z.

If you're interested in working together, here is a short summary of the roles I could fill and the services I could offer you, as well as a few criteria.

You can also find my [Resume][0] here.

### Criteria & Rates

I'm currently:
* Preferring freelancing and contracting (B2B), but open to permanent positions depending on conditions.
* Rates will depend on the tech, responsibilities (management, on-calls, work on week-ends) and/or my seniority relative to the role.
* For positions where I prefectly match, my daily rate starts at **EUR 500** (hourly: roughly **EUR 60**).
* Looking for full remote, or hybrid positions with monthly gatherings (inside Europe).
* Open to all durations, but with a high preference for missions of **at least** a month.
* Comfortable with asynchronous work and operating in different timezones, as well as the increased communication requirements this implies.

### Positions

Positions I would feel comfortable to fill:
* Backend Engineer - Proficient with Elixir, Ruby, 12+ years of experience; interests in Go, Python, Scala.
* DevOps or SRE - 4+ years with the ownership of a complete AWS infrastructure, CI/CD, Kubernetes, debugging/tracing and on calls.
* Product Engineer - Comfortable with impersonating user cases and delivering useful features.
* Platform Engineer - Comfortable with building or improving tools or CI workflows to improve developer experience.

Also open to:
* Full-stack and Frontend development - Comfortable with the [PETAL][1] stack.
* Tech Lead - Comfortable with leading small teams (2-4 developers) and interacting with designers, PO, PM, roughly 2 years of experience.
* Junior Engineering Manager (hands-on) - Comfortable with interacting with the C-suite, open to new challenges.

### Missions (Examples)

Here's a list of missions that I could handle for you:
* Developping features,
* Project Management,
* Cloud Infrastructure setup and optimization,
* Improving Developer Experience,
* Debugging, Deploying, Monitoring and Measuring,
* Refactoring, Clustering and Scaling existing services,
* Implementing App-Level Observability (OpenTelemetry),
* ...and more.

### Principles

* I like clean work but I'm not dogmatic with acronyms. I'm a supporter of [Dave Thomas' philosophy][4].
* Tests are a necessary investment that'll save credibility AND sales. But redundant tests are unproductive.
* Software must **never** crash.
* There's almost no "One tool to rule them all", different problems require different solutions and Domain-Specific Languages.

### Let's get in touch!
